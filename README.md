# Surfs_Up
## Overview
This project uses data from an SQLite database. The data is used to run a weather analysis to asses the viability of a surf and ice scream shop in the Oahu, Hawaii. We connected the data from the SQLite database and created dataframe in pandas. We looked at specifically June and December temperatures because of how different the weather is at those times of the year being two completely opposite seasons.
## Results 
From the results we obtained after creating separate dataframes for June and December temperatures, we can deduce that the shop can indeed by viable for the entire year. We notice that the temperatures in June is a max of 85 (F) degrees and an average of nearly 75 degrees (F). Comparing it to December, although a cooler month, it is a slight dip which causes no need for concern on the viability of the shop. The December temperatures are a max of 83 degrees (F) andan average of 71 degrees (F).
